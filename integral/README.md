#integral
In this subfolder we collect Python code for performing the numerical integration
of the function log g(t) = log k(e^t) over [0, log(4/3)], 
required for calculating the exponent of the asymptotic bound of the Sum(Pow(3,4)) counting function.

Obviously this comprises code to evaluate the function k(c) at given points c in [1, 4/3].
